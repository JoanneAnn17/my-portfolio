                    <div><p>I use HTML as a foundation to create structured, accessible, and responsive web pages that
                     bring my ideas to life. From building personal projects to designing portfolio websites, HTML
                      empowers me to craft interactive forms, dynamic content, and visually engaging layouts that
                       communicate effectively with users across devices.
                     It’s a key tool in shaping my digital presence and demonstrating my technical capabilities
                      in the evolving web landscape.</p>

                <h2><strong>CSS</strong></h2>
                <div><p>CSS is my go-to tool for styling and bringing visual appeal to my web pages. By leveraging
                     CSS, I create layouts that are not only responsive but also visually engaging, ensuring a seamless
                      experience across different devices and screen sizes. From typography to color schemes and animations, 
                    CSS allows me to express creativity and design web pages that align with user needs while maintaining a 
                    professional aesthetic</p>

                <div><p>I use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to my web projects, creating dynamic user
                     experiences that go beyond static content. From form validation to interactive elements like sliders
                      and modals, JavaScript allows me to implement real-time features that enhance user engagement.
                     It’s a vital tool that empowers me to solve problems creatively and bring my ideas to life through 
                     functional, responsive web applications.</p>
